# Minesweeper
First TCSS 360 Group Project

This is my personal submission, along with the group submission in the other repo.

Our group:
Vince T Nguyen
Foziya Husen
Brandon Rosario

We used IntelliJ for as our IDE of choice, since we decided it was much cleaner and easier to use.

The Minesweeper and Minesweeper Input Generator took about a full day for us, and testing/debugging took another day 
or two. We had some trouble connecting with each other, and agreeing on how the code should turn out. 
The code at this current state does all of the required functions, yet it still seems quirky at parts.
I figure it is fine, since projects like these are usually a component of a much bigger program.
